        <h1>The Netlify Learning Center & Me</h1>
        <p>I recently spoke with Daniel Freeman about the opportunity of working for Netlify as the content marketer and developer of the “Netlify Learning Center”. This Learning Center would focus on content that would improve SEO for Netlify in order to gain the attention of new potential users who are searching for topics related to Netlify’s services.  I’m a user and fan of Netlify, so I’m excited at idea of creating useful, long-lasting information about it’s services.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Andrew Grano - a front-end developer with over 7 years of experience.</p>

            <p>I currently work as a mentor and teacher at the Cal State Northridge META+LAB.</p>

            <p>I have a passion for what I do and an appreciation for the DIY spirit of the web (which I believe Netlify is reviving)!</p>

            <p>For details on my skills and background, please see my portfolio website: <a href="https://www.andrewgrano.com/" target="andrewgrano">andrewgrano.com</a></p>

            <h2>What can I contribute?</h2>
            <p>I feel fully confident in my ability to...</p>
            <ul>
              <li>build a learning center website using a SSG and the Netlify CMS. (I’m capable of building and designing it independently - although I would be happy to collaborate with Netlify’s internal teams to drive the direction and aesthetics) </li>
              <li>write articles from the standpoint of a front end developer with experience using netlify’s services. </li>
              <li>create tutorials on how to integrate with Netlify’s various service. And can include sample projects for readers to fork and use (via github or codepen).</li>
              <li>create informational videos, as I have experience with editing video. </li>
            </ul>

            <p>As discussed with Daniel, I’m also confident talking with educators about their student’s needs and incorporating that feedback into my content. </p>

            <p>Other than tasks related to the Learning Center, I’d also be happy to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contribute my front-end development/design skills to Netlify’s “internal agency”</li>
              <li>Help answer questions on community.netlify.com </li>
              <li>Present any applicable “learning center” content in some manner during Netlify’s JAMstack conference </li>
