        <h1>The Netlify Learning Center & Me</h1>
        <p>I recently spoke with Daniel Freeman about the opportunity of working for Netlify as the content marketer and developer of the “Netlify Learning Center.” This Learning Center would focus on creating content to improve SEO for Netlify and gain the attention of potential users who search for topics related to Netlify’s services.  As a user and fan of Netlify, I’m excited at the idea of creating useful, long-lasting information about its services.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’m Andrew Grano - a front end web developer with over 7 years of experience. ✅</p>

            <p>I currently work as a mentor and teacher at the Cal State Northridge META+LAB. 🍎</p>

            <p>I have a passion for what I do and an appreciation for the DIY spirit of the web (which I believe Netlify is reviving!)</p>

            <p>For details on my skills and background, please see my portfolio website: <a href="https://www.andrewgrano.com/" target="andrewgrano">andrewgrano.com</a></p>

            <h2>What can I contribute?</h2>
            <p>I am fully confident in my ability to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Build a Learning Center website using a SSG and the Netlify CMS. 🏗️ <br>(I’m capable of building and designing it independently - although I would be happy to collaborate with Netlify’s internal teams to drive the direction and aesthetics) </li>
              <li>Write articles from the standpoint of a front end developer with experience using Netlify’s services. ✍️ </li>
              <li>Create tutorials on how to integrate with Netlify’s various service. I can include sample projects for readers to fork and use (via github or codepen). ⌨️</li>
              <li>Create informational videos, as I have experience with video editing. 🎞️ </li>
            </ul>

            <p>As discussed with Daniel, I’m also confident talking with educators about their students' needs and incorporating that feedback into my content. </p>

            <p>Other than tasks related to the Learning Center, I’d also be happy to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Contribute my front-end development/design skills to Netlify’s “internal agency”</li>
              <li>Help answer questions on community.netlify.com 🤔</li>
              <li>Present any applicable Learning Center content in some manner during Netlify’s JAMstack conferences 🎤</li>
              <li>Anything else that the company might need from me! </li>
            </ul>

              <h3>💪 Strengths:</h3>

                <li>An understanding of Netlify and the needs of its users (and potential users)</li>

            <h2>Past experience with creating content related to Learning Centers</h2>
            <p>For the past year, I’ve been a teacher and mentor on the subject of front-end development at Cal State Northridge’s META+LAB. I’ve lectured on topics including HTML, CSS, Javascript, Responsive Web Design, Bootstrap, Sass, Vue.js and more. </p>
            <p>Here are some of the powerpoint presentations that accompanied my lectures. Creating these presentations helped me learn how to organize content in a way that your audience can easily understand and remain engaged by. 🎓</p>

            </ul>

            <p>I would also like to share two other documents that I worked on in the past year. One is a wiki article that I drafted to concisely explain the BEM naming convention that the developers at META+LAB are to follow. The other is documentation that I wrote on a CSUN-branded bootstrap theme which I created. This documentation was built using a SSG with a theme that I drastically customized.</p>

            </ul>

            <p>I’d also like to share with you some blog posts that I wrote several years ago during my first job out of college as a web designer at DecoNetwork (an e-commerce CMS platform for apparel). The blog posts offer different CSS tricks for users on how to customize their store. 📝</p>

            <p>I’ll also point to this blog post that I wrote on roaminglove.com, a website that I built and designed which features travel stories from authors around the world. 🌎</p>
